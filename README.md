# Train-Scheduler

<img src="assets/images/train_scheduler.png" >

Heres how the App works:

You can add trains with the following info:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes

This app will calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

Using Firebase users from many different machines will be able to view the same train times.
